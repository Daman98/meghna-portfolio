          <h2 class="section-title">Why what & how</h2>
          <p class="main-text">Currently, transferring fixed assets between legal entities is a manual, time-consuming process. Accountants must dispose of the asset in one company and manually acquire it in another, increasing the risk of errors and data inconsistencies. The process lacks integrated tools for seamless transfers, especially when asset splits are needed.</p>
          <h3 class="subsection-title">Why are we solving</h3>
          <ul class="main-list">
            <li>Manual process that required switching between LE to complete the transfer process.</li>
            <li>Manual filling in of data results in errors</li>
            <li>There is no current way to track history of the transfer</li>
            <li>The current process demands her to calculate the split & change flows which results in errors</li>
            <li>There is no way currently to transfer assets in bulk and single selection process of transferring assets is time consuming</li>
          </ul>
